# Plant-Recipes-React
A side project I am working on to strengthen my knowledge of React/JS/HTML/CSS and also an introduction to backend development and APIs!
This project also combines my interest in creating simple, healthy, but delicious foods & meals that are mostly plant based as it is a recipe site
to host my own creations in the kitchen!

# Technologies Used
### back-end ###
- Uses MongoDB to host data of recipes
- Uses NodeJS and Express to access & update data, and create API to connect backend to frontend

### front-end ###
- Uses React to build frontend through components & routing to load different pages

# Installation & Usage
- Run the database when in backend directory
  - `cd backend`
  - `npm run dev`
- Run the frontend when in frontend directory 
  - `cd frontend`
  - `npm start`

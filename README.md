# plant-recipes-react
A side project I am working on to strengthen my knowledge of React/JS/HTML/CSS and also an introduction to backend development and APIs!
This project also combines my interest in creating simple, healthy, but delicious foods & meals that are mostly plant based as it is a recipe site
to host my own creations in the kitchen!

# back-end / server side
- Uses MongoDB to host data of recipes
- Uses NodeJS and Express to access & update data, and create API to connect backend to frontend

# front-end
- Uses React to build frontend through components & routing to load different pages

# running the app
- Run the database when in backend directory
  - cd into backend
  - `npm run dev`
- Run the frontend when in frontend directory 
  - cd into frontend
  - `npm start`
